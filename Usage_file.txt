This usage file contains insturctions on how to execute the following algorithms correctly.

Please note similarities between this document and EHN P3 Instructions are similar due to the nature of the practical.

Firstly, a key must be generated. This refers to the 'rsakeygen', see an example of execution below.

./rsakeygen -bitLen 1024 -fopub pubkey.txt -fopriv privatekey.txt -init "RC4initkey"

Secondly, encrypting different file types. This refers to the 'rc4', see an example below.

./rc4 -e -fi test.txt -fo rc4_testfile.rc4 -key rc4key.txt
./rc4 -d -fi doe.rc4 -fo rc4_testfile.png -key rc4key.txt

Thirdly, RSA encryption. See example of encryption using the 'rsaencrypt' below.

./rsaencrypt -key "MyKeyis12334" -fo rsa_encrypt.rsa -fopub pubkey.txt

Finally, decryption using RSA. See example below.

./rsadecrypt -fi rsa_encrypted.rsa -fopriv priv.txt -fo decrypted_key.txt
